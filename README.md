Vela Telescope Control System
=============================

Vela is an Android 5 application to control the fan, heater, temperature sensors,
digital setting circles, and motor drive of a Dobsonian telescope. 

You need :
  - an Android 5 smartphone or tablet,
  - an Arduino Uno,
  - the Arduino software for Telescope Control,
  - a bluetooth-to-serial convertor for the Arduino,
  - digital encoders,
  - temperature sensors,
  - a fan to cool the primary mirror,
  - heaters,
  - motors for the azimuth and altitude axis.
  
The Android application will interface with DeepskyLog (http://www.deepskylog.org) to get a list with objects
and to import the Observing Lists.

Telescope Control is developed to work with my telescope and my settings. I hope to find some testers and developers
who want to test the software on other setups.
