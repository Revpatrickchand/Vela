TelescopeControl
================

Telescope Control is an Android 5 application to control the fan, heater, temperature sensors and 
digital setting circles of a Dobsonian telescope.

You need :
  - An android 5 smartphone or tablet. 
  - An Arduino Uno
  - The Arduino software for TelescopeControl
  - A bluetooth to serial convertor for the Arduino.
  - Digital encoders
  - Temperature sensors
  - Ventilators
  - Heaters
  
Telescope Control is developed to work with my telescope and my settings. I can not guarantee that it will
work on other setups.
