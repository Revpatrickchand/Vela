TelescopeControl
================

Telescope Control is an Android 5 application to control the fan, heater, temperature sensors,
digital setting circles and motor drive of a Dobsonian telescope. 

You need :
  - An android 5 smartphone or tablet. 
  - An Arduino Uno
  - The Arduino software for TelescopeControl
  - A bluetooth to serial convertor for the Arduino.
  - Digital encoders
  - Temperature sensors
  - A fan to cool the primary mirror
  - Heaters
  - Motors for the azimuth and altitude axis.
  
The Android application will interface with DeepskyLog (http://www.deepskylog.org) to get a list with objects and to import the Observing Lists.
Telescope Control is developed to work with my telescope and my settings. I hope to find some testers and developers who want to test the software on other setups.
